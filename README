= Nitro

    Nitro is a Web Application Framework. Nitro applications are implemented with Javascript and leverage (strict) Web Standards like XHTML/HTML, CSS, HTTP, XML, XSLT, ECMAScript 3.0, MicroFormats, etc. Nitro applications are typically a collection of programs that run on the server *and* the client. A control program dispatches work to the application programs and aggregates their output. This output is consumed by modern web browsers or web services (external programs) through a standard REST interface.

    Nitro is a higher level application framework that sits on top of the lower level Jack application framework. Leveraging Jack's simplicity and flexibility, Nitro is implemented as a collection of Jack middleware apps. Moreover, given the lack of a standard JavaScript library, Nitro implements a small and carefully designed library of useful functionality. This library follows the latest developments in the 'serverjs' discussion group.
