= Nitro

Nitro is a Web Application Framework. 
    
Nitro applications are implemented with JavaScript and leverage (strict) Web Standards like XHTML/HTML, CSS, HTTP, XML, XSLT, ECMAScript 3.0, MicroFormats, etc. Typically, Nitro applications are a collection of programs that run on the server *and* the client. A control program dispatches work to the application programs and aggregates their output. The application's output is consumed by modern web browsers, web services or other applications through a standard REST interface.

Nitro is a higher level application framework build on top of the lower level Jack web server gateway interface and Narwhal standad JavaScript library. Leveraging Jack's simplicity and flexibility, Nitro is implemented as a collection of Jack middleware apps. Nitro provides 'just-enough' functionality on top of Jack by implementing a small and carefully designed library for web application development. Moreover, Nitro runs on top of Rhino and has full access on all Java libararies.

== Getting Started

At the moment, Nitro requires customized versions of Narwhal and Jack. Please get patched versions from:
    
http://github.com/gmosx/jack
http://github.com/gmosx/narwhal

After you have installed Narwhal and Jack you are ready to run the simple example:

$ cd examples/simple
$ jackup 

The application will start listening at localhost:8080, so use your favourite browser (FireFox?) to verify that everything works correctly.

== Directory structure

/lib:
    Contains the implementation of standard library code that complements the Narwhal library
    
/src/nitro:
    Contains the implementation of the web application framework
    
/examples/simple:
    Contains a simple example        

/examples/blog:
    A sophisticated example, implements a real world blog.
    
== Caveats

Nitro is under intense development. Changes to the API are to be expected.
