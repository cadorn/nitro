Google App Engine
=================

Nitro is compatible with Google App Engine. The Narwhal [appengine](http://github.com/gmosx/appengine) package is a component of the Ecosystem.

For an example Nitro application that runs on AppEngine and leverages AppEngine services like the DataStore, download and study the [blog-gae](http://github.com/gmosx/blog-gae) example.
