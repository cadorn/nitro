A simple Nitro example

This is a very simple example. To start make sure you have the nitro command in 
the path and give:

$ nitro app.js

Then browse localhost:8080:

localhost:8080/
    A simple template with one interpolated param

localhost:8080/hello
    The mandatory Hello World

localhost:8080/stream
    A simple streaming example
	
There is not much to see in this example so go on and try the more advanced blog
