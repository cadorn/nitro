= A simple weblog powered by Nitro.

A simple blog is the defacto standard example for a Web Application Framework. This is Nitro's version.

This example strives to use clean and semantically rich markup. For this reason it uses HTML5 tags (header, footer, aside, article etc) and MicroFormat css classes (hAtom).

This example is more elaborate than it really needs to be. This is understandable though as the goal is to demonstrate as many features and best practices of Nitro. 

Please note that you need MySQL to run this example.

= Running the example

First of all, you have to configure the application for your system. Open your favourite text editor and edit the file:

$ vi etc/config.js

Then just use jackup to run the application:

$ jackup
